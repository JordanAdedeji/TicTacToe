# TicTacToe

This is our first group project, we were assigned the task of making a game, so we chose to make a version of the classic TicTacToe game.

## Getting Started

The whole repo needs to be cloned and the index.html file needs to be run in a browser.  Some of the files are located in folders and need to stay there in order for the tests to run and also, of course, for the code itself to run succesfully.

### Prerequisites

There are no special requirements in order to run this code other than a browser that's compatible with our JS code.

## Running the tests

We've used the Jasmine testing framework in order to test our code, the files required to replicated these tests are included in the repo, run 'SpecRunner.html' in the route of the repo to show test results.

### Break down into end to end tests

We chose to use Jasmine to test the initial state of the app and also functionality.
